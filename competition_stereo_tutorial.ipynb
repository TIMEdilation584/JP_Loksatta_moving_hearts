        "To support our Stereo Competition on [EvalAI](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1704/overview), we have made available ground-truth depth for [Argoverse v1.1](https://www.argoverse.org/av1.html#stereo-link), derived from lidar point cloud accumulation. We used our [scene flow method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00320.pdf) to accumulate lidar points from 11 frames and adopted evaluation metrics from the great [KITTI stereo challenge](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?benchmark=stereo). However, in comparison to KITTI, our stereo images have 10 times the resolution and 16 times as many training frames — making it a much larger and more challenging dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Argoverse Stereo consists of rectified stereo images and ground truth disparity maps for 74 out of the 113 Argoverse 3D Tracking Sequences. The stereo images are (2056 x 2464 pixels) and sampled at 5 Hz. The dataset contains a total of 6,624 stereo pairs with ground truth depth, although we withhold the ground truth depth for the 15 sequence test set.\n",
